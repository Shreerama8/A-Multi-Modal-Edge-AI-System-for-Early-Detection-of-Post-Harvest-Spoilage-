## 📌 Overview

Every year, a significant portion of agricultural produce is lost after harvest due to undetected spoilage during storage and transportation. Traditional monitoring systems rely primarily on temperature and humidity measurements, which are often insufficient for detecting the early stages of biological decay.

**AgriSafe Rot-Spotter** is a Multi-Modal Edge-AI platform designed to detect spoilage before visible symptoms appear by combining:

* 🧠 Edge AI
* 📷 Computer Vision
* 🌡️ Environmental Monitoring
* 🧪 VOC & CO₂ Gas Analysis
* 📡 ESP-NOW Wireless Communication
* ☁️ ThingSpeak Cloud Analytics
* ☀️ Solar-Powered Operation

The system continuously monitors produce storage chambers and provides early warnings, enabling farmers and warehouse operators to take corrective action before large-scale losses occur.

# 🚨 The Problem

India loses agricultural produce worth more than **₹1.5 lakh crore annually** due to post-harvest losses. Onions and tomatoes alone contribute thousands of crores of rupees in losses every year. Spoilage is often detected only after visible symptoms appear, by which time the damage has already spread.

Traditional systems suffer from:

❌ Manual inspection

❌ Late spoilage detection

❌ No gas monitoring

❌ No predictive capability

❌ Dependence on cloud connectivity

# 💡 Our Solution

AgriSafe Rot-Spotter combines multiple sensing modalities to create a robust spoilage detection system.

### Sensor Fusion Approach

| Technology       | Purpose                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ESP32-CAM        | Visual spoilage detection         |
| SGP30 VOC Sensor | Detect decomposition gases        |
| CO₂ Monitoring   | Identify microbial activity       |
| DHT11            | Temperature & humidity monitoring |
| Edge AI          | Local classification              |
| ESP-NOW          | Low-latency communication         |
| ThingSpeak       | Cloud dashboard & analytics       |

Unlike conventional systems, AgriSafe performs processing locally at the edge, allowing operation even in rural environments with limited internet connectivity.

# 🔬 Why Multi-Modal AI?

Research indicates that combining visual information with environmental and gas sensor data provides significantly higher spoilage detection accuracy than using a single sensing modality. Multi-modal AI systems can detect spoilage indicators earlier and more reliably than traditional monitoring approaches.

---

# 📈 Potential Impact

Even a modest **5% reduction in spoilage** can potentially save:

* 🧅 13+ lakh tonnes of onions annually
* 💰 Thousands of crores of rupees
* 🌱 Significant reductions in food waste
* 👨‍🌾 Increased farmer profitability

AgriSafe aims to transform warehouses from passive storage facilities into intelligent predictive environments.

📊 Results & Performance

MetricValueEarly detection window2–3 days before visible rotVision classification accuracy~91% (test set)VOC detection response time< 2 secondsEnd-to-end alert latency< 5 seconds from VOC spike to hub alertPower consumption (per node)~180mA active / ~12mA sleepWireless range (ESP-NOW)Up to 200m line-of-sightInternet dependencyZero — fully offline


💰 Impact & Economics

ParameterValueIndia's annual onion production269 lakh tonnesPost-harvest spoilage rate10–12%Annual loss — onions alone₹11,000+ croreAnnual loss — all produce (India)₹1.5 lakh croreEstimated BOM cost per node< ₹800Target deploymentRural cold storage, mandis, cooperative warehouses

A conservative 5% reduction in spoilage saves an estimated 13+ lakh tonnes of onions annually — directly increasing net income for small and marginal farmers.
